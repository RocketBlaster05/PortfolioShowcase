This code was developed to solve a problem presented in HW4 of my Data Structures and Algorithms class:

The goal is to use a heap to manage the patients in a hospital.
Continually determine which patients should be operated on
first by doctors or treated by nurses depending on the severity
of their injuries and the time at which the patient arrived.

ESI 5 patients can be treated by nurses if all of the doctors are busy.
All ESI 1-4 patients must be treated by a doctor, with ESI 1 patients
being the highest priority with the most severe injuries, and ESI 5
patients being the lowest priority with the least severe injuries.

HW4Extra attempts to solve a harder problem, where a patient can change
ESI severities if their condition worsens or improves. The challenge
had to be done in O(log n) time to maintain efficiency.
