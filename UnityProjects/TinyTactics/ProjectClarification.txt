This code was developed in roughly two and a half days for a game jam project held by Noa and Liam Calice for their GameDevRocket course.
Game jam theme: Tiny Armies

------IMPORTANT------

The goal is for the player to outsmart the enemy AI in a strategic turn based battle. Using small clusters of tiny soldiers,
the player must plan ahead and form a strategy to beat back the enemy soldiers and emerge victorious.

Originally, the game was planned to have bosses for each playable faction that had a unique ability, but time ran out before
more progress could be made. Additionally, there was not enough time to implement sound effects into the game. A large portion
of time was spent implementing the combat system and the enemy AI system to be as bug free as possible.

There were two troop types available when the game jam closed, but the faction system is working as expected. Selecting a given
boss in the team select screen will accurately update all troops on the board to be from the correct faction.
