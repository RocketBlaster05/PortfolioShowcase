This code was from a project made following the GameDevRocket game development course by Noa and Liam Calice (BlackThornProd on YouTube)

------IMPORTANT------

This project relies on an old version of the Unity Asset store product called The FPS Engine, found here:
https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/templates/systems/fps-engine-218594

The old version was provided as an asset in the GameDevRocket game development course.

------IMPORTANT------

The goal of the game is to survive multiple waves of an increasing number of zombies. Over time, more difficult zombies
spawn, and the player must kill them as quickly as possible to get gold and a high amount of points.

The player has a limited amount of ammo and health, and must travel around the map to find various buy stations littered
about, which grant the player to buy more ammo or health by spending the gold they earned killing zombies.

There are also 3 gun shops, which cost a large sum of gold, that the player can invest in to have multiple weapons to
fight against zombies with. More weapons means more ammo, and in turn, more ways to kill the zombies.

Main Improvements after following along with the course:

- Improved main menu screen with more options, option to choose between the game and a practice range to test out weapons
- Improved settings screen, adding options for mouse sensitivity and other QoL settings
- Modified almost all weapon animations and weapon code to flow more smoothly
- Specifically for the shotgun, implemented a shell-accurate reload based on how many shells the player needed to reload
    --> For example, the default shotgun always reloaded 4 shells, even if the player only fired one of four shells from the gun.
        Now, the sound, animation, and timings of the shotgun reload are accurate to the number of shells the player fired.
- Movement and AI navigation improvements on slippery slope terrain. Made movement feel much more smooth and responsive.
- Added UI elements and audio cues indicating when waves of zombies were spawning and what wave the player was on
- General bug fixes and minor improvements all around
