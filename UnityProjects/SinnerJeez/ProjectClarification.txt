The goal is for the player to traverse through various levels, engaging in quick-paced 2D platformer combat.
The player transitions between Adam's light and dark forms to tackle various enemies/obstacles.

In light mode, Adam primarily uses ranged, crowd controlling abilities/attacks. In dark mode, Adam prefers to get
more physical and brutal with his attacks, prioritizing close quarters combat.

The game is built around synergizing these two playstyles by balancing cooldowns between the two modes and combining
their abilities to produce large amounts of damage. Final level features a boss. There are cutscenes between each level
to show some insight into the story/lore of the world.
