The goal is for the player to kill any enemies in their path as the adventurer attempts to stop the Demon Lord from
wreaking havoc on the adventurer's kingdom. The player comes across several strange altars that teleport them into
more enemies and closer to the location of the Demon Lord.

The player can move, block, attack, and dodge roll to move around or fight any enemies they come across. The player
can interact with altars and chests, after being prompted to do so by the game.

Each scene transition includes some details about the origin of the Demon Lord and the upcoming set of enemies the
player is going to face, leading up to the Demon Lord's big reveal.
