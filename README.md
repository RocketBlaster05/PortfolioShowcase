This is a portfolio of various Java and C# related projects I have done whether it be in school or for my own practice.

I have chosen three of my best school projects and some of my new Unity C# project files
to show off my programming skills and learning capabilities. Further descriptions for each project
can be read in text files labeled "ProjectClarification.txt" in each of the project folders.

To see the unity projects running in real time, please visit their respective pages:

I have provided sample text input files (if applicable) for my school Java projects to give more context
as to the type of information my code handled. The sample input files can be found under text files with
names such as "hwXinX.txt".
